            <p>Ethiopian food is very unique because we eat with our hands. We share a big plate as a sign of love and friendship. Sometimes we even feed each other, which is called a <strong>"Gursha."</strong></p>
            
            <p>The most important part of the meal is <strong>Injera</strong>. It is a sour, spongy flatbread made from a grain called Teff.</p>

            <h3>Dishes you must try:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Doro Wat:</strong> A spicy chicken stew. It takes a long time to cook and usually has hard-boiled eggs in it.</li>
                <li><strong>Shiro:</strong> This is made from powdered chickpeas. It is very popular during fasting seasons.</li>
                <li><strong>Kitfo:</strong> Minced raw beef mixed with spiced butter and mitmita.</li>
                <li><strong>Tibbs:</strong> Grilled or sautéed meat with veggies. It is very tasty!</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Did you know coffee originated in Ethiopia? We don't just drink it quickly; we have a whole ceremony for it that can take hours. It represents hospitality.</p>

            <h3>How we make the coffee:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Roasting:</strong> First, we wash the green beans and roast them on a pan over a fire. You can smell the smoke!</li>
                <li><strong>Grinding:</strong> We crush the roasted beans by hand using a mortar and pestle (Mukecha).</li>
                <li><strong>Brewing:</strong> The powder is put into a clay pot called a <em>Jebena</em> to boil.</li>
                <li><strong>Serving:</strong> We pour the coffee into small cups called <em>Cini</em>. We usually eat popcorn or bread while drinking.</li>
            </ol>
